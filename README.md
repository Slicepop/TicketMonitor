## TicketMonitor

### Description
Browser extension for Service Manager that can be toggled on to monitor incoming tickets and alert you when a new ticket arrives.

### Usage
1. Navigate to "REQUESTS" page in Service Manager
2. Open TicketMonitor extension
3. Toggle the switch on
4. Set tab aside until alerted of new ticket

### Best practice
This extension was quickly built and may experience untested issues, so it is advised now and then to manually check the incident page.
If you experience issues, please let me know so I can fix them.

### Roadmap
- Add interval duration selection for user
- Info dropdown in popup?
